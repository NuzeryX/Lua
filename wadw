Hello, Today, I would like to introduce you Max Holloway, a well-known UFC fighter. Max Holloway is 32 years old and comes from Hawaii, USA. He is a professional Mixed Martial Artist and a former UFC Featherweight Champion. Max is famous for his incredible cardio, high striking output, and record-breaking fights. For example, in one fight, he landed over 400 significant strikes--an all-time UFC record. Max’s routine is very intense. He starts his mornings with cardio or strength training, like running and weightlifting. Midday, he practices striking and grappling techniques, and in the evening, he sparrs to prepare for fights. He also takes time on weekends for recovery and rest. I chose Max Holloway because he is hardworking, inspiring, and a great role model.

That’s all I wanted to say. Thank you for your attention!
